What happens when you itintialize a repository and why do you need it?
A repository is where all of my tracked and untracked files are located 
on the local disk. Contrary to what I thought, I have not pushed 
anything to the GitHub cloud yet. I need to initialize a repository 
because that is how GitBash is going to be able to tell GitHub 
where the tracked files are located on the local disk. Also, the repository
has the hidden files and meta data necessary to track changes in files located
inside the repository, unlike a standard directory, which only contains the
saved files on the hard disk. 

How is the staging are adifferent from the working directory and the repository?
What value do you think it offers?
The staging area is different from the working directory because it is a happy 
medium between the actual files and the commit stage. At this point you aren't changing
anything. You are just organizing. The staging area you to allows you to set up and organize
logical changes in a way that makes sense and provides clarity to anyone working
on the same repository as you. It adds value to the git interface by allowing you to
work independently of the working directory.
